## Hey, I'm Josh Lipman

I'm passionate about building and scaling meaningful products.

Currently, I'm working in product [@uber](https://www.uber.com/) and researching novel NLP methods for information extraction in materials science [@ucla](https://www.ucla.edu/).

Previously, I founded [Belstad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/belstad/id6618159376), where we built agents for nonpartisan journalism.

In my free time, I like climbing rocks, hiking, backpacking, and practising jiu jitsu.
