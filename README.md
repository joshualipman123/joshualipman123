## Hey, I'm Josh Lipman

I'm passionate about building and scaling meaningful products.

Currently, I'm working in product [@uber](https://www.uber.com/) and researching AI in materials science [@ucla](https://dskoda.com/).

Previously, I founded [Belstad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/belstad/id6618159376), where we built an autonomous AI journalist.

In my free time, I like climbing rocks, hiking, backpacking, and practising jiu jitsu.
